Tbh the hardest part about it is the exam, as it requires a lot of detailed things from the course – you really need to know everything you did in class/lecture notes. However, the classes are very nice (if you follow them), the prof explains everything first in a very intuitive way (brings examples from real life) and then explains the theory parts, also there are problem sets which if you do they help a lot with exam material. Overall, if you are a micro > macro person, it's a good course with interesting content and material, the only thing that is hard is the exam. ;;;;; For Game Theory, the class is as hard as everyone says, this is due to one main reason – you are required to learn, know, understand and use the proper ""game theory notation"". The concepts and solving different problems isn't the hard part about the course, once you get it, it's fine. However, the prof is very adamant about using the proper notation (which is something completely new and you have to learn in like a new language), without which you cannot pass the course. So there is a lot of additional time you have to put in to get the hang of it – as if you don't automise it, you will struggle. ;;;; For those thinking about taking Advanced micro and Game Theory in the same semester – I think it's manageable, however, the third course you take HAS TO be easier and less time-consuming (otherwise, you will be stuck on the courses 24/7).",

Game theory is a nice course and don't get scared, it is hard but anybody who puts some work in can do it well. And most importantly, don't stress too much on the course selection, ESS lasts an undefined number of semesters, you will always get the chance to take a course again if you really want or if you change your mind ;)",
